Welcome to your first day on the job at SuperDuperSketchyCorp!

We have weekly security reading group at 12:30pm on Tuesdays in the stained
glass room on the 3rd floor of BBB. You are expected to read the weekly paper
before attending. You can sign up for the mailing list here:

If you need to connect to this server from a university device instead of
through our wireless access point, you can ssh to this server at
superdupersketchycorp.com on tcp port 47923 and access the web server at
www.superdupersketchycorp.com. You will not be able to access the server 
from outside the UM campus networks.

Welcome to the team. I'm sure you'll be very happy here.

Ben-nate Sprec, PhD
President
SuperDuperSketchyCorp

Note from EECS388 instructors:
Do not share the hint about hostname or port access with other groups. If a
group uses these ports to access the server without first breaking in through
the wireless network, we will consider it cheating. (Only one member of each
group must break in through the wireless network.)
