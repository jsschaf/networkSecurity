Overview:

The main objective of this penetration test is to determine the weaknesses of the networks and exposed systems of SuperDuperSketchyCorp. The goal is to test the security measures that SDSC has in place to protect their information and network, and to test them through various white hat attacks to analyze how the company can deal with malicious users trying to gain access or steal information.

Methodology:

During the first stage of the pen test we were able to gain access to the SDSC wireless network because the password format was revealed to be EECS388-xxx. We then used aircrack-ng and a wordlist with all possible password combinations in order to crack the password to the wireless network. Running “host superdupersketchycorp.com” revealed the IP address of the SDSC website to be 141.212.108.230. Using nmap to scan the IP address, we discovered two open ports, port 25 for smtp (or email) and port 80 (for http, noting this is not https and therefore not very secure). Since we knew the email server that SDSC relied upon, we sent a phishing email to learn a username and password combination the server. The poster that was in the lobby also gave us the method for this email creation. Using netcat port 25 of the SDSC.com ip address allowed us to create an email that appeared to be from a user in the corporation. We then redirected the Reply-to to our private email address, where we received a reply with a valid password for our given username.

After gaining login details and connecting to this wifi, we rescanned the network to find open ports. The command “nmap 192.168.0.0/24” revealed to us all of the open ports on the network. There were two addresses with open ports, 192.168.0.1 on port 22 and 192.168.0.25 on port 22. We were able to ssh into 192.168.0.25, and using our login details from the phishing email we we could access the server. Once in the server, we could scan all of the files that were present on the server. There was a Welcome text document that allowed us to gain another way to ssh into the server from another network as well as access to a web server to the superdupersketchycorp website. Going to superdupersketchycorp.com, we were able to browse around the links that were on the site and one stood out in particular, Admin. Our own credentials did not allow us to enter the webpage, but we now had access to the SDSC server. Looking into the server, we saw that there was a folder tools with tcpdump. We ran tcpdump for 90 seconds and analyzing the results we saw that there were HTTP protocol GET requests. Upon further examination, these GET requests were sending the plain text credentials to the server. We then found when the server responded with their OK authentication and found the credentials to be mattley:388roxmysocks. Logging into the admin page we see that there are 30% layoffs coming in March and we found the new password for the executive lounge.

[Extra Credit]
- First, recognised that hashlist was comprised of md5 hashes. Then, found an online list of common passwords and computed their md5 hashes. Then cross referenced this with the hashlist to find matches. 
- XOR’d the two encrypted messages to create one newfile.txt, which was the original msg1 xor msg2. Then used guess and check because we knew some words. For example, I guessed that one message would start with Alice, and by xor’ing Alice with the newfile.txt, I could work out that the other message started with Bob. Kept repeated this process with more and more letters/words until the whole message was revealed.

Remediation:

The only way we were able to get into the wifi and understand the email format for the phishing attempt was because of the flyer that was left in the lobby. We would recommend employee training so that they are aware not to leave sensitive documents behind. Additionally, this training could help them learn the common phishing techniques that we have employed and a system for reporting these types of questionable emails. The email server itself should be aware of reply-to field and prevent any reply-to emails that are outside of the company’s server (assuming that you can send an email from your company email, you can get email responses from it). The company should also employ a two-factor authentication technique, so if credentials were leaked, then the attacker would not have access to the users phone to get a text authentication. All of these factors are concerning the weakest link in any security protocol, the people. We would therefore recommend employee security training.
SuperDuperSketchyCorp should also change the format of their password. While the monthly-changing password is a good idea to keep out intruders, only having 3 changing characters means there are 46656 total possibilities of which the password would be. It is very easy to do a bruteforce attack to gain network access. To combat this, a password should be generated with upper and lowercase alphabet characters and digits. A simple 8 character password would have over 218 trillion combinations and would be much more secure than the current network password. We would also recommend that SDSC should not host mail services on the same server as the web server. By doing this, attackers can use the website’s IP address and use the smtp port to spoof an email. They should use a different mail server for all company email. Finally, we recommend that SDSC uses HTTPS rather than HTTP so that network traffic on the server is not sent in plaintext as it is currently. Using HTTPS will add an extra layer of security. It would have prevented the leaking of administrator credentials, as they would have been encrypted. In addition, passwords should never be posted in plaintext on a website such as they were in the secret message. To help prevent these errors, SDSC staff could undergo training as to network security best practices. 
[Extra Credit] SDSC should not rely on md5 to hash passwords, as this has been proven to be broken. They should also not reuse one time pads for message encryption. Training might be an effective solution so that people learn about these issues and how to protect against them.
