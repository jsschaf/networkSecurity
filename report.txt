Overview:

The main objective of this penetration test is to determine the weaknesses of the networks and exposed systems of SuperDuperSketchyCorp. The goal is to test the security measures that SDSC has in place to protect their information and network, and to test them through various white hat attacks to analyze how the company can deal with malicious users trying to gain access or steal information.  

Methodology:

The first stage of this pen test was to gain access to the SDSC wireless network. First, using a poster that was left in public site, the password format was revealed to be EECS388-xxx. Using this information, we were able to create a python program to generate a wordlist with all possible password combinations. Next, using the publicly available tool aircrack-ng, we could use this word list and a SDSC wireless network traffic capture to crack the password to the wireless network. 

Using this given password, we were able to successfully access the SuperDuperSketchyCorp wireless network. We then were trying to gain login details to successfully gain sever access. From the terminal, we entered the command “host superdupersketchycorp.com”, which revealed the IP address of the SDSC website to be 141.212.108.230. We then used the nmap tool to scan this IP address. This revealed to us two open ports, port 25 for smtp (or email) and port 80 (for http, noting this is not https and therefore not very secure). We now new the email server that SDSC relied upon, and would try to send a phishing email to learn a username and password combination the server. We knew the method for this email creation due to the poster that was left in public. We used netcat on port 25 of the SDSC.com ip address to create an email that appeared to be from a user in the corporation. We redirected the Reply-to to our private email address, where we received a reply with a valid password for our given username. 


After gaining login details and connecting to this wifi, we used the nmap command to scan the network to find hosts and open ports. The command “nmap 192.168.0.0/24” revealed to us an IP address that we could use to ssh into the server. We then gained access to the server thorugh the login details from the previous part. We then had access to various folders and files that we could browse. 

Steps to find ADMIN details:


For Extra Credit:
- First, recognised that hashlist was comprised of md5 hashes. Then, found an online list of common passwords and computed their md5 hashes. Then cross referenced this with the hashlist to find matches. 
- XOR’d the two encrypted messages to create one file, which was the original msg1 xor msg2. Then used guess and check because we knew some words. For example, I guessed that one message would start with Alice, and by xor’ing Alice with the newfile, I could work out that the other message started with Bob. Kept repeated this process with more and more letters/words until the whole message was revealed.
